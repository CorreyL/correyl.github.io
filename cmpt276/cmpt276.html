	<h3>CMPT 276: Introduction to Software Engineering (January 2016 - April 2016)</h3>
	<body>
	<p>
		In this course I was tasked with building a back-end for a hypothetical web-based or mobile application (such as a social network), specifically to store user-inputted data such as usernames, passwords, status updates, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		The back-end was set up as a tiered service as 4 different servers:</br>
		<img src="cmpt276architecture.jpg"/></br>
		<b>1. Low-Level Interface: Database Layer</b></br>
		The Database Layer is an interface to the Storage Layer, specifically <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/"><b>Microsoft Azure</b></a>. This ensures that if the application needs to be moved to another Cloud Storage Service, such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg"><b>Amazon AWS</b></a> or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/"><b>Google Cloud Datastore</b></a>, the only code that needed to be changed would be in this lowest-level service, without having to change any other part of the appllication.</br></br>
		
		Calls to the Database Layer have two parts: An HTTP Request Method and a URI </br></br>
		
		The Unix command <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/manpage.html"><b>cURL</b></a> were used to make calls to the server.
		<pre class="brush: cpp;">
		int main(){
			cout << "Test" << endl;
		}</pre>
		<b>2. Authentication: Secure Record Access</b></br>
		The basics of security for a cloud-based application were covered here, ensuring authenticated access to the service. Registered users required a username and associated password, and they were stored in a separate table in Microsoft Azure.</br></br>
		
		<b>3. High-Level Interface: Session Layer</b></br>
		</br>
	</p>
