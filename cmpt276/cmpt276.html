	<p>
	In this course I was tasked with building a back-end for a hypothetical web-based or mobile application (such as a social network), specifically to store user-inputted data such as usernames, passwords, status updates, etc.
	</p>
	<p>
		The data was stored using <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft Azure</a>, specifically their implementation of tables.
